#### Generic Data Structures in C
Like thousends of other programmers, i felt that i need to implement some data structures in pure C, with no objects. So i did it, using some of the background learned in the awsome Stanford Course "Paradigms of Programming".

There are:
* Stack -> implemented like java array list (resizable array).
* Queue -> idem.
* List -> deprecated.
* Vector -> like a java array list.
* Linked List -> it allows to store any kind of data or struct in the same list (like python lists).
* HashSet -> implemented using vector structure.
* HashMap -> idem.
