#### Generic Data Structures in C
Implementation of some data structures in pure C, with no objects.  

Starting from those explained in the awesome Stanford Course "Paradigms of Programming", and continued with other I have needed in my job, studied in other 
courses, books, etc.

* Stack:  implemented like java array list (resizable array).
* Queue:  idem.
* List:   deprecated.
* Vector: like a java array list.
* Linked List:  to store any kind of data or struct in the same list (like python lists).
* HashSet: implemented using vector structure.
* HashMap: idem.
